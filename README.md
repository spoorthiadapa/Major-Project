# Automatic Reader Based on Raspberry Pi


The Raspberry Pi processor board served as the foundation for this project. It acts as an interface
between the system and the user, controlling peripherals like the camera and speaker. This project
uses optical character recognition (OCR) to identify characters. The system then uses a speaker to
read the characters to the user. The camera is mounted on a substitute such a place that on the off
chance that a piece of paper is in the middle of between the areas set apart by precise supports,
it catches a full perspective on the paper into the framework. Additionally, the paper’s lighting is
checked before the picture is taken by the camera. The system takes the photo, processes it, and, if
it finds the document’s content, reads it out loud through the speaker if all these conditions are met.
The primary application of the TTS (Text to Speech) technology is the conversion of text files into
audio or voice. After the TTS unit is installed on the Raspberry Pi, its output is sent to the speaker,
where it is amplified with an audio amplifier.

Modules included in our project:

Image Capturing,
Image Pre-processing,
Image to Text Conversion,
Text to Speech Conversion

Conclusion and Future Scope:

Our focus is on enhancing the capabilities of blind people by providing them a solution so that
the information can be fed to them in the form of a speech signal.
As we are living in an era of technological development, so the room for improvement is always
there. A plan is implemented in proposed method for the text in different languages which will serve
millions of people. Moreover, more enhancements can be achieved by implementing it with high-
resolution focused cameras which will then improve the extraction of text and more efficient text to
speech synthesizer can be developed for swift conversation into the text. Also, the text editor can be
developed in which the extracted text can be written simultaneously to the audio output.
